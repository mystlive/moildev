## Example of Moildev library
**Code Examples to start prototyping quickly:** These simple examples demonstrate how to easily use the Library to include code snippets that process fisheye images.

## List of Example:

No | Name                                      | Description 
--- |-------------------------------------------| --- 
1 | [Create Object](Create_object)            | Create object to be able to use all functions
2 | [Create anypoint maps](anypoint)          | The purpose is to generate a pair of X-Y Maps for the specified zenithal angle, azimuthal angle, and zoom factor. 
3 | [Create Panorama maps](panorama)          | Use to generate a pair of X-Y Maps for alpha within 0 to alpha_max degree, the result X-Y Maps can be used later to generate a panorama image from the original fish-eye image. 
4 | [Anypoint](anypoint)                      | Return image with Anypoint view (mode 1 and mode 2).
5 | [Panorama](panorama)                      | Return the panorama image result. 
6 | [Reverse View](Reverse_view)              | Return the image with change optical points. 
7 | [Additional Functions](getAlpha_Beta_rho) | Return the value of alpha beta from the coordinate image given. 

Note:
- Code wrote in python
